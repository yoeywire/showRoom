Timecode lighting software for Windows

This project brings the functionality timecoding lightshows to my home! This program was designed to control adressable LED strips, and in the future this will be extended to other lighting fixtures as well. Timecode means that the lights can be synchronized to music tracks, by first programming effects for all the different fixtures onto a timeline. I hope to make this software run on a seperate Raspberry PI, and that I can trigger lightshows using Home Assistant/Google Assistant.

Currently the software is very experimental and lots of features still need to be added. I am doing this to get some experience with larger software projects, and because I really like lights! At the moment I am working on creating all the classes I need, and I am working on the effect engine!
